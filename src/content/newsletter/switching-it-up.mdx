Hey {{ first_name }},

After resting for a week, I'm prepared to take up another project.

This time, I'm going to put a couple of weeks of focus into setting up analytics so I can run advertisements for Magical Dev School. So **progress for Splendid Layouts will be halted** for a bit (approx 2 weeks).

I seek your understanding about this halt â€” especially if you purchased Splendid Layouts (previously known as CSS Layout Patterns) and you're eager to get the patterns and rehash the way you build your projects.

I'm pausing this because of two reasons:

1. I have to focus on my main business for a bit now
2. I want to give myself some breathing space for Splendid Layouts

I'll explain more if you're open to hearing it.

Note: Iâ€™m sharing this with you because I feel you have the right to know, either as a customer or as a person who may purchase one of my products soon.

I'm also sharing this with you because I want to **put the human back** into our communications â€” something I find sorely lacking in today's web world.

## Focusing on my main business

My main business ([Magical Dev School](https://magicaldevschool.com)) â€” which is about teaching web development in a way that makes sense â€” isn't doing well recently. I suspect the market has changed after COVID, the bouts of tech layoffs, and Google algorithm updates.

I also suspect it's because of the way I've written the message in the past (which I'm not proud of and want to change).

As a solo business founder, I have to keep the business going. If I don't, I may run out of business â€” and if that happens, both Splendid Layouts and Magical Dev School will cease to exist.

I'm trying to prevent this as much as you are â€” which is why I'll have to focus on the main business. Don't worry, I'll still keep working on Splendid Layouts. (See more in the next section).

## Giving myself some breathing space

I promised that after the documentations are done, components will rain. That's true, because I can build components incredibly quickly like how I demonstrated [last week](https://zellwk.com/blog/splendid-layouts-is-here). (It's already raining on my end).

But I'm facing a wall.

I've been thinking about **how to best present these** Components for Splendid Layouts.

The easiest way to present these components will be something like [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/components/marketing/sections/heroes), where I show you the component and give you a way to get the code (without any explanations).

I don't want to do that â€” because that wouldn't make sense for most people who haven't invested heavily into understanding the Splendid Layouts system yet.

(Try it: Click on the [Tailwind UI]() link, see a component, check the code, and get overwhelmed immediately ðŸ¤•).

Now, the code for Splendid Layouts is **incredibly elegant** so you won't see a wall of text staring straight back at you. But still, I don't think it's a great experience.

Instead, I want the Component Library to be **a guide** of some sort â€” so you can start simple (or small), and reconfigure how you think about building layouts and components in a smooth and gentle way.

And once you understand the entire system, you will feel the **epiphany** that I got â€” you can really build any layouts, quickly, effectively, and simply. There's so much elegance in the code that I cannot even describe with words.

So if I throw you a bunch of components, I think I'm doing you a disservice.

In addition, I also want to include some **variability** into the Component Library â€” sometimes it's about showing you different ways of doing something; sometimes it's about showing you how to enhance something.

The sad news is I haven't figured out how to present this to you yet.

Now I can push myself to work to deliver the "Tailwind UI Experience" (for the lack of a better term), but I would begin to hate this project. (I know, cause I tried pushing like this in the past).

I don't want to hate the project, burn out, and throw Splendid Layouts away â€” it's important to me. I want to protect this passion, beauty, simplicity, and elegance that I'm creating in this project.

So I'd like to give myself some breathing space before returning to work on it again. I'll be back to work on this once I handle what I need to with analytics and advertisements (that I'm currently testing).

You can probably expect to hear from me in about 2 weeks on the beginning of the next phase of Splendid Layouts.

I'd love to keep you updated on this.

## On Spam and Soulless Content

As Iâ€™m writing this email I canâ€™t help but wonder whether this email is considered spam to you.

Some people may say yes, some would say no. Thatâ€™s because everyoneâ€™s idea of spam is different.

Iâ€™ve been wondering what constitutes spam for a long time â€” and as a result of that, Iâ€™ve been paralysed and afraid to send you messages for the same amount of time.

But I took some time to address my thoughts on spam so I can move on and not stay stuck. [Hereâ€™s the article on spam](https://zellwk.com/articles/on-spam) if youâ€™re interested in reading it.

I'm also writing this because I don't want to write [soulless content](https://zellwk.com/blog/soulless/) anymore. I've done a lot of that in the past and it has hurt me beyond what I could imagine.

So every message that I send you will come from my heart.

This is a **big undertaking** because what comes from the heart is often scary, true, and (at least for me) they seem to be unwelcome by some people.

So I hope you're open to this sort of communication too.

There's one final thing I want to talk about â€” the cadence of new emails â€” but this one is getting long so I'd save it for the next time.

Hope you have a great week ahead.

Stay awesome
Zell

P.S. As I grow older (or wiser), Iâ€™ve come to understand that others say is often not about you, but about them.

P.P.S. I also realize I have less to say about web development the more I learn about it.
